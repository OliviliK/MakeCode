# MakeCode EV3 Applications
Working repositories of different applications in various development stages. The core idea is to provide a custom.ts file with application oriented functions
- for movements with mm instead of angles, rotations, or seconds
- turns with gyro sensor
- arcs with target radius and segment length
- calibration of multiple color sensors
- flexible assignment of motor ports, sensor ports, wheel size, motor rotation direction, and track width

The second idea is to provide consistent application interfce between EV3 and Spike Prime
