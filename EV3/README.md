# MakeCode EV3 Applications
Working repositories of different applications in various development stages. The core idea is to provide a custom.ts file with application oriented functions for
- movements with distance in mm instead of angles, rotations, or seconds
- turns with with given radius in mm using the gyro sensor
- movee arcs with given radius in mm and arc length in mm
- calibration of multiple color sensors
- movements using color sensors
- flexible assignment of motor ports, sensor ports, wheel size, motor rotation direction, and track width

The second idea is to provide consistent application interfce between EV3 and Spike Prime
